# Features
The main highlights of our project:
- Our project offers a user-friendly interface and educational content for users who want to improve their typing speed, providing an engaging learning experience.
- Login:
	- Our project supports creating and using accounts with JWT. This way, users can save their progress.
	- If users just want to try it without creating an account, they can log in as a guest. However, this only opens a 7-day session, and after one week, their progress will be lost.

# Installation
If you want to clone and use the code, here are the steps:  

## 1. Set up the `.env` file
The project needs certain variables to run properly. These are listed in the `.env.example.env` file.

## 2. Install the modules
First, navigate into the backend folder:
```terminal
cd backend
````

Then install the modules:

```terminal
npm install
```

Once done, the project modules will be installed and ready to use.

## 3. Run the server

After setting up the `.env` file and installing the modules, you can start the server in 2 ways.

### 1. Start normally

```terminal
npm run start
```

or

```terminal
node server.js
```

### 2. Start with nodemon

For development purposes:

```terminal
npm run devStart
```

or

```terminal
nodemon server.js
```

## 4. Open the project site

To open the project site, go to the `welcome.html` file with the port you configured:

```URL
http://localhost:{your-configured-port}/html/welcome.html
```

Or simply go to the localhost address, and youâ€™ll be redirected to the homepage automatically:

```URL
http://localhost:{your-configured-port}
```

# To-Do

1. Add more levels to our project.
2. Our project does not fully support Google login yet â€” we will fix this.
3. Our project does not support Facebook login!!! We added the button thinking weâ€™d implement it later but gave up. Please ignore it.
4. Even though you receive a code via email during registration, there is no interface to enter the code yet â€” weâ€™ll add this ðŸ˜….
5. Unfortunately, finishing levels is not supported yet â€” weâ€™ll bring this in the next update.
